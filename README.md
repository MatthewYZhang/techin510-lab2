# Finance Data Explorer

Matthew Zhang

## Getting Started

```bash
# This time we will not use virtual env  
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py
```

## Deployment Page

## What I learned

- Use yfinance package to read real-time stock data
- Use pandas to manipulate dataset
- Use streamlit to draw plots and charts to represent data

## Questions

- How can I write the code so that the two charts (price chart and volume chart) move together?
